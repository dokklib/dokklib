# Azure Review

## Playing Catch Up

Amazon Web Services initially caught Microsoft by surprise, but at least since Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Azure has stepped its game and continues to grow at an astonishing rate. Microsoft also seems to get serverless, but according to my totally non-scientific judgement, AWS is still ahead, because of the breadth of their serverless services and the velocity that they keep pushing forward with. 

I don't have enough experience with Azure to give you a well-grounded overview of their serverless offerings, so there is no verdict here. 

If you run serverless in production on Azure, make sure to share your experience in the [issues](https://github.com/dokklib/dokklib/issues) please!
