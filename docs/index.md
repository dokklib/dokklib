# Welcome to Dokklib

Dokklib is a collection of libraries and obsessively detailed guides to building web applications with the serverless stack. 

!!! note
    Dokklib is work-in-progress and updated daily. You can [subscribe](https://dokklib.substack.com/subscribe) to a weekly newsletter or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/agostbiro) to see what's new. Feedback is much appreciated on [Github.](https://github.com/dokklib/dokklib)

## Why Dokklib

Building a serverless application can be an overwhelming experience. There are so many providers and frameworks to choose from, and discovering the best mix and their idiosyncrasies takes a lot of time and effort. Dokklib contains all the knowledge I’ve gained while building [Dokknet](https://dokknet.com) so you don’t have to waste your time discovering it again.

Dokknet is a [forkable company](https://blog.agostbiro.com/2020/01/a-forkable-company/) which means that its code is not only open source, but also makes it easy to replicate its service. Thanks to this, you get a living application along with Dokklib where you can check for yourself if you're ever in doubt about how it all fits together.

Dokklib is opinionated in the best sense of the word: I describe what has worked me and why, and I also share if I have any doubts about my solutions.

## Contents
