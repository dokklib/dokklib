## Your Guide To The Serverless Stack

Dokklib is a collection of libraries and obsessively detailed guides to building web applications with the serverless stack.

Building a serverless application can be an overwhelming experience. There are so many providers and frameworks to choose from, and discovering the best mix and their idiosyncrasies takes a lot of time and effort. Dokklib contains all the knowledge I’ve gained while building [Dokknet](https://dokknet.com) so you don’t have to waste your time discovering it again.

Dokknet is a [forkable company](https://blog.agostbiro.com/2020/01/a-forkable-company/) which means that its code is not only open source, but also makes it easy to replicate its service. Thanks to this, you get a living application along with Dokklib where you can follow along if you're ever in doubt how it all fits together.

Dokklib is opinionated in the best sense of the word: I describe what has worked me and why, and I also share if I have doubts about my solutions.
